        content: `Let's be real. That soda you're holding? It's 90% sugar and chemicals dressed up in fancy packaging.

Cheap sweeteners. Artificial fizz. Zero nutrition. All hype.

Masala soda wasn't always like this. It used to be bold, real, made for taste — not profit margins.

Then big brands took over. Chemistry replaced craft. And we all just... accepted it.

Not anymore.

ZfO is bringing back the real deal. Clean ingredients. Zero BS. Proper masala kick. Glass bottle only.

Your body deserves better than liquid sugar. Drink different.`
