        content: `Let's be real. That soda you're holding? It's 90% sugar and chemicals dressed up in fancy packaging.

Cheap sweeteners. Artificial fizz. Zero nutrition. All hype.

Masala soda wasn't always like this. It used to be bold, real, made for taste — not profit margins.

Then big brands took over. Chemistry replaced craft. And we all just... accepted it.

Not anymore.

ZfO is bringing back the real deal. Clean ingredients. Zero BS. Proper masala kick. Glass bottle only.

Your body deserves better than liquid sugar. Drink different.`

Here's the plot twist: that energy drink isn't helping. Neither is coffee #5. Your body wants water. Period.

Hydration isn't boring—it's the ultimate glow up hack. Better skin. Sharper brain. More stamina to actually live your life.

Stop treating water like a side character. Make it the main event.

ZfO's got you: real hydration with actual flavor. No sugar crash. No fake energy. Just pure, sparkling satisfaction in glass.

Level up your water game. Your future self will slide into your DMs with gratitude.`

        content: `Picture this: 1950s India. Street vendors crushing ice. Hand-pulled soda machines hissing. That first spicy-sweet hit that made you forget the heat.

Masala soda wasn't invented in a boardroom. It was born from necessity—and perfected by hustlers.

Every region had its twist. Mumbai's got the boldness. Delhi brought the spice. South India? That citrus game was unmatched.

Then corporate happened. Plastic bottles. Syrup concentrate. The soul got packaged out.

We're bringing it back. Same spirit. Better execution. Glass bottles only. Made for people who remember— and those who deserve to taste what they missed.

This isn't nostalgia. This is restoration.`

        content: `You've seen the tweets. You've watched the documentaries. And yet—that soda fridge at your office is still all plastic.

Let's talk numbers. One million plastic bottles bought every minute worldwide. Less than 9% actually recycled. The rest? In oceans. In landfills. In your food chain.

Microplastics are now in human blood, lungs, placentas. We're literally drinking and eating our own pollution.

Glass changes everything. Infinitely recyclable. Zero leaching. Keeps your soda colder, fizzier, cleaner.

ZfO ships exclusively in glass because there is no Planet B. And because your drink shouldn't taste like petroleum byproducts.

Choose glass. The future isn't optional.`

We chose chaos.

Not the bad kind—the kind that disrupts. The kind that questions why soda has to be predictable. Why it has to be syrupy sweet. Why it has to come in plastic.

ZfO exists because we got tired of 'good enough.' Tired of artificial everything. Tired of pretending mass-produced sugar water is refreshing.

Masala soda chose us. That first sip—the citrus zing, the spice warmth, the bubbles that wake up your whole mouth. That's not a drink. That's an experience.

We're not here to compete with big soda. We're here to make them irrelevant.

Join the fizz rebellion.`
