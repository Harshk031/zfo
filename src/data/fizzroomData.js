        content: `India consumes over ₹60,000 crore worth of soda every year.
Most of it is liquid sugar, artificial flavoring, and empty calories wrapped in shiny branding.

That "refreshment" you're drinking?
It's engineered addiction.

Cheap sweeteners.
Synthetic fizz.
Zero nutrition.
Zero honesty.

And nobody talks about it.

Masala soda was never meant to be this.
It was bold. Sharp. Real. Made for taste — not margins.

Somewhere along the way, it got hijacked by shortcuts and chemistry.

Gen Z isn't stupid anymore.
People read labels. They question ingredients. They reject fake products.
Yet the shelves are still full of the same old junk.

That's the real gap.

ZfO exists to rebuild soda the right way —
clean formulation, zero preservatives, zero sugar calories, unapologetic masala punch, premium glass.

Not louder marketing.
Not cheaper shortcuts.
Just a better drink.

Because your body pays the bill — not the brand.`
